Django webapp for Kindle highlights.

Curate your highlights for others. Inspired by Sawyer H's [Reading Highlights](https://highlights.sawyerh.com/) page. Larger plan is to build a [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) back-end, something like the excellent Readwise.io webapp. MVP will let you generate Anki decks.

I host a demo at https://kindlerweb.herokuapp.com/

Note that this project is nowhere near complete. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!

Thanks to [TheInkEdge](https://www.instagram.com/theinkedge/?hl=en) for help with the front-end :)
